      summary: Retrieval of the PSU accounts (AISP)
      description: |
        <h3>Description</h3>
         This call returns all payment accounts that are relevant the PSU on behalf of whom the AISP is connected.
         Thanks to HYPERMEDIA, each account is returned with the links aiming to ease access to the relevant transactions and balances.
         The result may be subject to pagination (i.e. retrieving a partial result in case of having too many results) through a set of pages by the ASPSP. Thereafter, the AISP may ask for the first, next, previous or last page of results.
        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
         <ul>
         <li>The TPP has been registered by the Registration Authority for the AISP role.</li>
         <li>The TPP and the PSU have a contract that has been enrolled by the ASPSP</li>
         <ul>
         <li>At this step, the ASPSP has delivered an OAUTH2 "Authorization Code" or "Resource Owner Password" access token to the TPP (cf. § 3.4.2).</li>
         </ul>
         <li>The TPP and the ASPSP have successfully processed a mutual check and authentication</li>
         <li>The TPP has presented its OAUTH2 "Authorization Code" or "Resource Owner Password" access token which allows the ASPSP to identify the relevant PSU and retrieve the linked PSU context (cf. § 3.4.2) if any.</li>
         <li>The ASPSP takes into account the access token that establishes the link between the PSU and the AISP.</li>
         </ul>
        <h3>Business Flow</h3>
         The TPP sends a request to the ASPSP for retrieving the list of the PSU payment accounts.
         The ASPSP computes the relevant PSU accounts and builds the answer as an accounts list. 
         The result may be subject to pagination in order to avoid an excessive result set. 
         Each payment account will be provided with its characteristics.

         The PSU specifies to the AISP which of his/her accounts will be accessible and which functionalities should be available.
         The AISP forwards these settings to the ASPSP.
         The ASPSP answers by HTTP201 return code.

        <h3>Description</h3>

        The following use cases can be applied:

        <ul>
         <li>payment request on behalf of a merchant</li>
         <li>transfer request on behalf of the account's owner</li>
         <li>standing-order request on behalf of the account's owner</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Data content</h4>

        A payment request or a transfer request might embed several payment
        instructions having
         <ul>
         <li>one single execution date or multiple execution dates</li>
         <ul>
         <li>case of one single execution date, this date must be set at the payment level</li>
         <li>case of multiple execution dates, those dates must be set at each payment instruction level</li>
         </ul> 
         </ul> 
         Each implementation will have to specify which business use cases are actually supported.<br/> 
         A standing order request must embed one single payment instruction and must address one single beneficiary.
         <ul>
         <li>The beneficiary must be set at the payment level</li>
         <li>The standing order specific characteristics (start date, periodicity...) must be set at the instruction level</li>
         </ul> 
         Payment request can rely for execution on different payment instruments:
         - SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT)
         - Domestic Credit Transfer in a non Euro-currency
         - International payment
         The following table indicates how to use the different fields, depending on the payment instrument:

        <h4>Prerequisites for all use cases</h4>

        <ul>
         <li>The TPP has been registered by the Registration Authority for the PISP role</li>
         <li>The TPP was provided with an OAUTH2 "Client Credential" access token by the ASPSP (cf. § 3.4.3).</li>
         <li>The TPP and the ASPSP have successfully processed a mutual check and authentication </li>
         <li>The TPP has presented its "OAUTH2 Client Credential" access token</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Business flow</h4>
         <h5>Payment Request use case</h5>
         The PISP forwards a payment request on behalf of a merchant.<br>
         The PSU buys some goods or services on an e-commerce website held by a merchant. Among other payment method, the merchant suggests the use of a PISP service. As there is obviously a contract between the merchant and the PISP, there is no need of such a contract between the PSU and this PISP to initiate the process.<br>
         Case of the PSU that chooses to use the PISP service:<br>
         <ul>
         <li>The merchant forwards the requested payment characteristics to the PISP and redirects the PSU to the PISP portal.</li>
         <li>The PISP requests from the PSU which ASPSP will be used.</li>
         <li>The PISP prepares the Payment Request and sends this request to the ASPSP.</li>
         <li>The Request can embed several payment instructions having different requested execution date.</li>
         <li>The beneficiary, as being the merchant, is set at the payment level.</li>
         </ul> 
         <h5>Transfer Request use case</h5>
         The PISP forwards a transfer request on behalf of the owner of the account.
         <ul>
         <li>The PSU provides the PISP with all information needed for the transfer.</li>
         <li>The PISP prepares the Transfer Request and sends this request to the relevant ASPSP that holds the debtor account.</li>
         <li>The requested execution date, as being the same for all instructions, is set at the payment level.</li>
         </ul> 
         <h5>Standing Order Request use case</h5>
         The PISP forwards a Standing Order request on behalf of the owner of the account.
         <ul>
         <li>The PSU provides the PISP with all information needed for the Standing Order.</li>
         <li>The PISP prepares the Standing Order Request and sends this request to the relevant ASPSP that holds the debtor account.</li>
         <li>The Request embeds one single payment instruction with</li>
         <ul>
         <li>The requested execution date of the first occurrence</li>
         <li>The requested execution frequency of the payment in order to compute further execution dates</li>
         <li>An execution rule to handle cases when the computed execution dates cannot be processed (e.g. bank holydays)</li>
         <li>An optional end date for closing the standing Order</li>
         </ul>
         </ul> 
        <h4>Authentication flows for all use cases</h4>
         As the request posted by the PISP to the ASPSP needs a PSU authentication before execution, this request will include:
         <ul>
         <li>The specification of the authentication approaches that are supported by the PISP (any combination of "REDIRECT", "EMBEDDED" and "DECOUPLED" values).</li>
         <li>In case of possible REDIRECT or DECOUPLED authentication approach, one or two call-back URLs to be used by the ASPSP at the finalisation of the authentication and consent process :</li>
         <ul>
         <li>The first call-back URL will be called by the ASPSP if the Payment Request is processed without any error or rejection by the PSU</li>
         <li>The second call-back URL is to be used by the ASPSP in case of processing error or rejection by the PSU. Since this second URL is optional, the PISP might not provide it. In this case, the ASPSP will use the same URL for any processing result.</li>

         </ul>
         The ASPSP saves the request and answers to the PISP. The answer embeds:
         <ul>
         <li>A location link of the saved Request that will be further used to retrieve the Request and its status information.</li>
         <li>The specification of the chosen authentication approach taking into account both the PISP and the PSU capabilities.</li>
         <li>In case of chosen REDIRECT authentication approach, the URL to be used by the PISP for redirecting the PSU in order to perform a authentication.</li>
         </ul>
         Case of the PSU neither gives nor denies his/her consent, the Request shall expire and is then rejected to the PISP. The expiration delay is specified by each ASPSP.<br>
         <h5>Embedded authentication approach</h5>
         When the chosen authentication approach within the ASPSP answers is set to "EMBEDDED":<br>
         <ul>
         <li>The TPP informs the PSU that a challenge is needed for completing the Payment Request processing. This challenge will be one of the following:</li>
         <ul>
         <li>A One-Time-Password sent by the ASPSP to the PSU on a separate device or application.</li>
         <li>A response computed by a specific device on base of a challenge sent by the ASPSP to the PSU on a separate device or application.</li>
         </ul>
         <li>The PSU unlock the device or application through a "knowledge factor" and/or an "inherence factor" (biometric), retrieves the Payment Request details and processes the data sent by the ASPSP; </li>
         <li>The PSU might choose or confirm which of his/her accounts shall be used by the ASPSP for the future Credit Transfer when the device or application allows it.</li>
         <li>When agreeing the Payment Request, the PSU enters the resulting authentication factor through the PISP interface which will forward it to the ASPSP through a confirmation request (cf. § 4.7)</li>

      summary: Retrieval of a payment request (PISP)
      description: >
        <h3>Description</h3>

        The following use cases can be applied:

        <ul>
         <li>retrieval of a payment request on behalf of a merchant</li>
         <li>retrieval of a transfer request on behalf of the account's owner</li>
         <li>retrieval of a standing-order request on behalf of the account's owner</li>
        </ul>

        The PISP has sent a Request through a POST command. <br>
         The ASPSP has registered the Request, updated if necessary the relevant identifiers in order to avoid duplicates and returned the location of the updated Request.<br>
         The PISP gets the Request that has been updated with the resource identifiers, and eventually the status of the Payment/Transfer Request and the status of the subsequent credit transfer.<br>
        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

        <ul>
         <li>The TPP has been registered by the Registration Authority for the PISP role</li>
         <li>The TPP was provided with an OAUTH2 "Client Credential" access token by the ASPSP (cf. § 3.4.3).</li>
         <li>The TPP has previously posted a Request which has been saved by the ASPSP (cf. § 4.5.3)</li>
         <ul>
         <li>The ASPSP has answered with a location link to the saved Payment/Transfer Request (cf. § 4.5.4)</li>
         </ul>
         <li>The TPP and the ASPSP have successfully processed a mutual check and authentication </li>
         <li>The TPP has presented its "OAUTH2 Client Credential" access token</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Business flow</h3>

        The PISP asks to retrieve the Payment/Transfer Request that has been
        saved by the ASPSP. The PISP uses the location link provided by the
        ASPSP in response of the posting of this request.<br>

        The ASPSP returns the previously posted Payment/Transfer Request which
        is enriched with:<br>

        <ul>
         <li>The resource identifiers given by the ASPSP</li>
         <li>The status information of the Payment Request and of the subsequent credit transfer</li>
        </ul>

        The status information must be available during at least 30 calendar
        days after the posting of the Payment Request. However, the ASPSP may
        increase this availability duration, based on its own rules.<br>

      summary: Modification of a Payment/Transfer Request (PISP)
      description: >
        ### Description

        The PISP sent a Payment/Transfer Request through a POST command.

        The ASPSP registered the Payment/Transfer Request, updated if necessary
        the relevant identifiers in order to avoid duplicates and returned the
        location of the updated Request.

        The PISP got the Payment/Transfer Request that has been updated with the
        resource identifiers, and eventually the status of the Payment/Transfer
        Request and the status of the subsequent credit transfer.

        The PISP request for the payment cancellation (global cancellation) or
        for some payment instructions cancellation (partial cancellation)

        No other modification of the Payment/Transfer Request is allowed.

        ### Prerequisites

        - The TPP was registered by the Registration Authority for the PISP role

        - The TPP was provided with an OAUTH2 "Client Credential" access token
        by the ASPSP (cf. Â§ 3.4.2).

        - The TPP previously posted a Payment/Transfer Request which was saved
        by the ASPSP (cf. Â§ 4.5.3)
          - The ASPSP answered with a location link to the saved Payment/Transfer Request (cf. Â§ 4.5.4)
          - The PISP retrieved the saved Payment/Transfer Request (cf. Â§ 4.5.4)
        - The TPP and the ASPSP successfully processed a mutual check and
        authentication 

        - The TPP presented its "OAUTH2 Client Credential" access token.

        - The TPP presented the payment/transfer request.

        - The PSU was successfully authenticated.


        ### Business flow

        #### Payment/Transfer request cancellation circumstances

        The cancellation of a Payment/Transfer request might be triggered by the
        PISP upon request of the PSU.

        It can also be triggered by the PISP itself in case of error or fraud
        detection.

        Since the consequence of the cancellation will be a rejection of the
        Payment/Transfer request globally or limited to some of its
        instructions, the modification of the payment request will focus on
        setting the relevant status to the value "CANC".

        This "CANC" status must however be explained through a reason code that
        can be set with the following values:


        | Reason | description |

        | ------ | ----------- |

        | DS02 | The PSU ordered the cancellation. |

        | DUPL | The PISP requests the cancellation for a duplication of a
        previous Payment/Transfer request |

        | FRAD | The PISP requests the cancellation for fraudulent origin of the
        Payment/Transfer request |

        | TECH | The PISP requests the cancellation for a technical issue on its
        side |


        #### Payment/Transfer request cancellation level

        - Case of a payment with multiple instructions or a standing order, the
        PISP asks to cancel the whole Payment/Transfer or Standing Order Request
        including all non-executed payment instructions by setting the
        [paymentInformationStatus] and the relevant [statusReasonInformation] 
        at payment level.

        - Case of a payment with multiple instructions, the PISP asks to cancel
        one or several payment instructions by setting the [transactionStatus]
        and the relevant [statusReasonInformation] at each relevant instruction
        level.


        Since the modification request needs a PSU authentication before
        committing, the modification request includes:

        - The specification of the authentication approaches that are supported
        by the PISP (any combination of "REDIRECT", "EMBEDDED-1-FACTOR" and
        "DECOUPLED" values).

        - In case of possible REDIRECT or DECOUPLED authentication approach, one
        or two call-back URLs to be used by the ASPSP at the finalisation of the
        authentication and consent process :
          - The first call-back URL will be called by the ASPSP if the Transfer Request is processed without any error or rejection by the PSU
          - The second call-back URL is to be used by the ASPSP in case of processing error or rejection by the PSU. Since this second URL is optional, the PISP might not provide it. In this case, the ASPSP will use the same URL for any processing result.
          - Both call-back URLS must be used in a TLS-secured request.
        - In case of possible "EMBEDDED-1-FACTOR" or "DECOUPLED" approaches, a
        PSU identifier that can be processed by the ASPSP for PSU recognition.
          
        - The ASPSP saves the updated Payment/Transfer Request and answers to
        the PISP. The answer embeds 
          - The specification of the chosen authentication approach taking into account both the PISP and the PSU capabilities.
          - In case of chosen REDIRECT authentication approach, the URL to be used by the PISP for redirecting the PSU in order to perform an authentication.
          
        Case of the PSU neither gives nor denies his/her consent, the
        Cancellation Request shall expire and is then rejected to the PISP. The
        expiration delay is specified by each ASPSP.

        If any modification of the payment request other than cancellation is
        applied by the PISP, the ASPSP must rejest the request with HTTP403
        without modifying the payment request resource.

      summary: >-
        Confirmation of a payment request or a modification request using a
        standard PSU authentication (PISP)
      description: >
        ### Description

        The PISP confirms one of the following requests or modifications

        - payment request on behalf of a merchant

        - transfer request on behalf of the account's owner

        - standing-order request on behalf of the account's owner

        The ASPSP answers with a status of the relevant request and the
        subsequent Credit Transfer.


        ### Prerequisites

        -  The TPP has been registered by the Registration Authority for the
        PISP role

        -  The TPP was provided with an OAUTH2 "Client Credential" access token
        by the ASPSP (cf. Â§ 3.4.2).

        -  The TPP has previously posted a Request which has been saved by the
        ASPSP (cf. Â§ 4.5.3)
          - The ASPSP has answered with a location link to the saved Payment Request (cf. Â§ 4.5.4)
          -  The TPP has retrieved the saved request in order to get the relevant resource Ids (cf. Â§ 4.6).
        -  The TPP and the ASPSP have successfully processed a mutual check and
        authentication 

        -  The TPP has presented its "OAUTH2 Client Credential" access token 
          
        ### Business flow

        Once the PSU has been authenticated using a standard procedure (non
        OAUTH2), it is the due to the PISP to confirm the Request to the ASPSP
        in order to complete the process flow.

        The ASPSP must wait for confirmation before executing the subsequent
        Credit Tranfer.

        API: 

        This field indicates the date at which the debtor account should be
        debited. 

        In most of the cases, especially for international payments, the date of
        the credit on the credit account cannot be set. Only SCTInst can
        guarantee having the same date for this credit. 

        This date can be used in the following cases:

        - the single requested execution date for a payment having several
        instructions. In this case, this field must be set at the payment
        level. 

        - the requested execution date for a given instruction within a payment.
        In this case, this field must be set at each instruction level. 

        - The first date of execution for a standing order.

        When the payment cannot be processed at this date, the ASPSP is allowed
        to shift the applied execution date to the next possible execution date
        for non-standing orders.

        For standing orders, the [executionRule] parameter helps to compute the
        execution date to be applied.

        The payment is then executed either the "preceding" or "following"
        working day.

        ASPSP might reject the request due to the communicated value, if rules
        in Online-Banking are not supporting 

        this execution rule.

    presented to Socram Banque via the Generic Mailbox
    "openbanking@socrambanque.fr", to be able to access the API Open Banking
    production it must provide the following information: <ul><li

    </br> <div style="font-size: 12px; word-break:break-word;"> Each request
    sent by the TPP has to be signed using http-signature mechanism which is
    specified by the following IETF draft-paper: <ul><li style="font-size:
    12px"><a
    href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cavage-http-signatures/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cavage-http-signatures/</a></li>
    </ul> ASPSP might also apply http-signature to their responses. The way it
    should be implemented is the following </br> <ul> -  Computing a SHA256
    digest of the HTTP body and adding this digest as an extra HTTP header. If
    there is not body, then the digest is computed by a SHA256 empty chain </ul>
    <ul> -  Using a specific Qualified Certificate (QSealC), respecting the
    ETSI/TS119495 Technical Specification, in order to apply a RSA-SHA256
    signature on <ul><li style="font-size: 12px">  all the following headers
    that are present within the HTTP request sent by the TPP, including the

You need to get an acces_token related to a persona.
      </br>
      <ul style="font-size: 12px"><b style="font-size: 14px">Retrieving Access Code</b></ul>
      First, You need to retrieve an accessCode (confirmation_code). Click on the Authorize button and enter the client id. Enter one of the client_id from the following list. To put it simply, they have the same name as the authorized scopes.
      </br></br>
      <table border="1" style="width:200px"><thead><tr><td>client_id</td><td>scope</td></th></tr></thead><tbody<tr><td>aisp</td><td>aisp</td></tr><tr><td>cbpii</td><td>cbpii</td></tr><tr><td>aispcbpii</td><td>aisp and cbpii</td></tr><tr><td>pisp</td><td>pisp</td></tr></tbody></table>
      </br>
      <ul style="font-size: 12px"><b style="font-size: 14px">Retrieving Access Token</b></ul>
      Then you need to retrieve an accessToken. Call the url 'https://api.socrambanque.fr/openbanking/AS/token_test' using  client_id and client_secret (client_id = client_secret) as Authorization and put the accessCode inside the request body under the name "code".
      You also need to add inside the request body "grant_type": "authorization_code"
      and the "redirect_uri".
      </br></br>
      If success, you'll receive two access token (one for each persona). Inquire the one you want under the field access_token.
      </br></br>
      <ul style="font-size: 12px"><b style="font-size: 14px">Access Token Revocation</b></ul>
      To revoke a token, you call the '/openbanking/AS/revoke' endpoint which takes as parameter 'token_type_hint', which is value can be "access_token" or "refresh_token" and 'token' with the right value</br></br>
      exemple: 'https://api.socrambanque.fr/openbanking/AS/revoke?token_type_hint=access_token&token=hyefeyghjshjsdsdcx'
      </br></br>
      Now, you are ready to test the Openbanking APIs.
